        If there were any code just inside ...script... tag but not inside window.onload then when would that be executed? Before window.onload or after or during?
    </li>
    <li>
        Google chrome and some other browsers expose __proto__ property of a js object. This __proto__ can even be assigned (so little bit risky)
    </li>
    <li>
        __proto__ of a normal js object will refer to Object instance which defines methods like ...hasOwnProperty..., ...toString..., ...isPrototypeOf... etc.
    </li>

</ul>

<script type="text/javascript">

    // if there were any code in this place that would have been executed when? before window.onload or after or during?

    window.onload = function() {
        const book = { 'publisher': 'apress' };
        console.log(book.__proto__);
        console.log(book.hasOwnProperty('publisher'));// true
        console.log(book.hasOwnProperty('toString'));// false

        if(!book.__proto__.__proto__) {
            console.log('__proto__ of __proto__ of book is undefined');
        }
    }
