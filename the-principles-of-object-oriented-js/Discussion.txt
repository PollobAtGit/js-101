# JavaScript has five primitive types. They are followings:
    ## Number
    ## String
    ## Boolean
    ## null
    ## undefined

# All of the above primitive types has a literal representation as well as a object representation.

# An JS object is an un-ordered list of properties consisting of name & values

# Functions themselves are reference types in JS

# Objects in JS are simply dictionary/hash table with property keys and their corresponding values

# JS is a garbage collected language. If any reference type object has no usage/has no reference associated with it
    then that object will be collected by garbage collector. Deferencing can be done just by setting null to
    that variable

# Built-in types in JS are:
    RegExp
    Function
    Object
    Array
    Date
    Error

# String wrapper object can hold individual properties similar to any other JS object. Following will work:

    {code: JS}

        var strWrapperObj = new String('STRING');
        strWrapperObj.lastName = 'OBJ';
        console.log(strWrapperObj.lastName);//'OBJ'

        var str = 'STRING';
        str.lastName = 'OBJ';
        console.log(str.lastName);//undefined

    {code}

# String
