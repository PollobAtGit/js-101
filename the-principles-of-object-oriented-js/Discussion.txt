# JavaScript has five primitive types. They are followings:
    ## Number
    ## String
    ## Boolean
    ## null
    ## undefined

# All of the above primitive types has a literal representation as well as a object representation.

# An JS object is an un-ordered list of properties consisting of name & values

# Functions themselves are reference types in JS
